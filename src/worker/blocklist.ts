/**
 * Permanent slug-pattern blocklist. Slugs matching any rule below are

 * never get an article, never get a moderation row, never get logged
 * anywhere persistent — they just 404. Used for harassment / impersonation
 * patterns that the moderation sweep wouldn't reliably catch on title
 * alone.
 *
 * Slugs are already lowercase ASCII by the time they reach this check
 * (slugify normalizes them), so substring/prefix matching is naturally
 * case-insensitive.
