/**
 * VPN / commercial-hosting denylist. Cloudflare populates `request.cf.asn`
 * and `request.cf.asOrganization` for free on every request, with zero
 * latency. We use the ASN to refuse LLM-spending paths (generation,
 * search-hallucination) for traffic originating from datacenter / VPN-
 * backbone ASNs that produce nearly all the spam.
 *
 * Cache hits and pure DB reads are still served — so a legitimate user
 * who happens to be on a VPN can still read existing articles. Only the
 * paths that cost money are blocked.
 *
 * The denylist is sourced from the community-maintained
 *   https://github.com/bountyyfi/bad-asn-list
 * and embedded at `bad-asns.ts`. To refresh:
 *
 *   curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bountyyfi/bad-asn-list/refs/heads/main/all.txt \
 *     | awk '/^AS[0-9]+/{gsub("AS","",$1); print $1}' | sort -n | uniq \
 *     | awk 'BEGIN{print "export const BAD_ASNS: ReadonlySet<number> = new Set(["} {printf "  %s,\n", $1} END{print "]);"}' \
 *     > src/worker/bad-asns.ts
 *
 * (Re-add the header comment after regenerating.)
