/**
 * Presence — single Durable Object tracking who is reading what, in real time.
 *
 * Design (from the brainstorming round):
 *   - One global DO. Every WebSocket from every reader lands here. At
 *     halupedia's traffic level (low thousands of concurrent at HN-peak)
 *     a single DO is well below the ~10k–30k WS practical ceiling, and
 *     keeping state in one place is dramatically simpler than per-slug DOs.
 *   - Hibernation API: state.acceptWebSocket() means an idle DO is evicted
 *     from memory. We don't pay for sitting-idle CPU. Subsequent
 *     webSocketMessage / webSocketClose events wake it.
 *   - No heartbeats, no sendBeacon. Departures are detected by the runtime
 *     firing webSocketClose() — works across tab close, navigation, network
 *     drop, OS sleep, browser kill.
 *   - Per-WS state lives in ws.serializeAttachment(). Counts are recomputed
 *     by walking state.getWebSockets() on every broadcast tick, so we never
 *     need to keep a separate Map in sync with hibernation.
 *
 * Protocol:
 *   client → server   {"t":"r","s":"slug-or-null","ti":"Title"}
 *                     "I'm now reading <slug>". slug=null means "connected
 *                     but not on an article" (search / all-entries).
 *   server → client   {"t":"hi"}
 *                     Sent once on accept.
 *   server → client   {"t":"top","items":[{"s":"slug","ti":"Title","n":12}]}
 *                     Top-N broadcast, sent on every tick where the top
 *                     changed. Same payload to every WS — cheap fan-out.
 *   server → client   {"t":"here","s":"slug","n":23}
 *                     Per-client. Sent when the count for THIS client's
 *                     current slug changes since we last told them.
 *
 * Broadcast cadence: BROADCAST_INTERVAL_MS via DO alarm. Events schedule the
 * alarm if one isn't already pending; the alarm fires once, broadcasts, and
 * doesn't auto-reschedule. Idle DO has no alarm running.

// NOTE on titles:
//   Titles are NOT stored per-socket. The old design kept `ti` on each
//   websocket attachment and then picked "the first non-empty title from
//   any live socket on that slug" when building the top-N. That had two
//   fatal flaws:
//     1. During a slug change, the client briefly held the *previous*
//        article's title in state, so it shipped `{s: newSlug,
//        ti: oldTitle}` on the navigation frame. That stale pair won the
//        first-non-empty race and got frozen into `lastTop`.
//     2. The subsequent corrected message `{s: newSlug, ti: realTitle}`
//        never triggered a fresh broadcast (only slug *changes* did), so
//        the wrong title persisted on every other reader's sidebar.
//   The fix is structural: titles live in a single DO-level map, indexed
//   by slug, last-non-empty-write-wins. Counts are derived from live
//   sockets; titles are derived from this map. The two concerns are now
//   independent, which is what the architecture wanted in the first place.
